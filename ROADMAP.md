### atomicity of metadata operations like rename


## Object Storage (OS)


### richer APIs


## Personal Cloud Storage (CS)


###  CubeFS for Android


Not only for datacenters, also for mobile devices. CubeFS will work as the storage infrastructure for cloud-enabled mobile applications run on any Android devices.
