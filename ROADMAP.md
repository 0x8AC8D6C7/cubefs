# Roadmap

Here we draft several todo features and the engineering roadmap of CubeFS. 

## Datacenter Filesystem (FS)

- Multi-version snapshots for versioned data lake

- Atomicity of metadata operations like rename


## Object Storage (OS)

- Richer APIs


## Personal Cloud Storage (CS)

- User management, sharing, and high-level APIs. Not only in datacenters, but also on mobile devices.
